## simulated-annealing
# Example of a simulated annealing algorithm applied to IKEA store location data, written in R.

This code was written for a project to solve a p-median problem with the Ikea store locations in Sweden.
## The objectives are:
- Find the 19 optimal Ikea locations in Sweden using a Simulated Annealing algorithm.
- Find the cost of the above algorithms to the cost of the true Ikea locations.
